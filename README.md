# CoffeeBrewApp
 
Description
The idea is to create an app much like Vivino and Untapped, but instead of wine and beer, its focus will be around coffee. 
As coffee is a very common product in all shapes and forms, there is as much potential for it as wine and beer, yet, not all coffee is equally good. 
When finding a new delicious coffee product, it would be nice to be able to share it with friends and family, as well as give a personal rating on the product.

My motivation behind the app is to help out my friend, who enjoys different sorts of coffee on a regular basis, but with all these different coffees it can be hard to keep track of them all. Furthermore, when he would find an excellent coffee product, he had no way to share the experience other than texting all his friends.

The app will provide a user friendly environment for all ages to be able to share and discover coffee products. 
For APIs the initial thought is that of Google maps, in order for users to check in where they bought the product, as well a potential API concerning the coffee products, so as to have these registered somewhere.
